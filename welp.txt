take one down and pass it around, 9 bottles of beer on the wall

decrementing

var num = 100;
while (num >= 0){
	console.log(num + " bottles of beer on the wall, " + num + " bottles of beer.);
	num--;
	console.log("take one dowm and pass it around, " + num + " bottles of beer on the wall");
}

Fibonacci sequence 

Basiclly, the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous 2 numbers
2 =	1 +	1
n = (n-1) + (n -2) to do this we have to access the elements of the array like this 
var arr[];
arr[arr.lenght - 2] + arr[arr.lenght - 1];

[0, 1, 1, 2]

n.lenght return an int

var array[n];
if (array[n] === 0)
n =
